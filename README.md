# Auth-Lock

Auth-Lock is a web application built with Angular. It provides a robust user authentication system, allowing users to register, login, and logout. The application also includes an admin panel for user management.

## Features

- User Registration: New users can create an account.
- User Login: Registered users can log in.
- User Logout: Logged-in users can securely log out.
- Admin Panel: Admin users can manage user roles.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Run backend

Run `node server.js`

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
